# Reliability Test Todo App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Server side

1. Install Node.js and make sure to have npm available.
2. In the backend folder directory, run 'npm install'.
3. Run 'node app.js' in the backend folder directory.
4. Dev server now runs on localhost:3000.

## Client side

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) to view it in your browser.

## NOTES:

You MUST run the backend server first before starting the client, as the backend is set for localhost:3000 and the client side will be 3001 (it'll try to start up as 3000 but select to not have it do that).
